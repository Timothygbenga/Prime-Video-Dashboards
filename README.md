## *Introduction*

The evolment of videos can be traced back to an invention of a French man called Louis Le Prince in 1888 who was often considered as the brain behind the first motion sequences. He used a single-lens camera and paper film to record the "Roundhay Garden Scene" in Leeds, England. This innovation has been widely embraced all over the world and this has been tramisitted through cable networks for easy access.

### Recommendations
---
**Rating:** 

In order to keep improving and spreading, Prime video should intensify effort in showing movies and tv series for under 18 class so as to register the brand in their subconscious mind while growing up.Though the streaming industry seems to be very competitive with the like of Netflix, Disney, peacock etc, It is the good time to catch them young.

**Update of movies and Tv series:**
Our finding has reveaaled the more new movies are updated the higher people subscribe. Hence, update should be done frequently in order to have more subscribers.
